#**Node-RED Automated Installation Script**
This repository provides an automated Node-RED installation script for Linux-based systems. This script updates your system, installs dependencies, sets up Node-RED, and ensures it runs on boot using systemd.

#**Introduction**
This tutorial will guide you through using an automated script to install Node-RED on a Linux system. The script will set up:

**Node.js version 18**

**Node-RED and related packages**

A systemd service to ensure Node-RED runs on boot

#Prerequisites
**Before running the script, ensure the following:**

A Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

A non-root user with sudo access

Internet access to download necessary packages

**How to Use the Script**
You can run the script directly from GitHub without needing to download or save the file. Follow the instructions below:

****Option 1**: Run the Script Directly from GitHub**
To execute the script directly from GitHub, run the following command in your terminal:


**Copy**
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hzqzbrdn/node-red-installation/main/nodered_install.sh | bash
This command will:

**Download the script**

Automatically execute the installation process

**Option 2: Clone the Repository and Run the Script**
Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the script manually:

Clone the repository:

**Copy**
git clone https://github.com/hzqzbrdn/node-red-installation.git
cd node-red-installation
Make the script executable:


**Copy**
chmod +x nodered_install.sh
Run the script:


**Copy**
./nodered_install.sh
Verifying the Installation
After running the script, you can verify the Node-RED setup by:

**Checking the status of the Node-RED service:
**

**Copy**
sudo systemctl status nodered
Accessing the Node-RED editor:

Open a web browser and go to:


http://YourIP:1880
This will open the Node-RED editor where you can start building your flows.

#**Troubleshooting**
Here are some common troubleshooting steps:

**Service fails to start:**
If Node-RED fails to start after reboot, check the service logs with:


**Copy**
sudo journalctl -u nodered
Permission issues:
Ensure the correct user has permission to access the required directories:


**Copy**
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/.nvm
Missing dependencies:
If the script fails due to missing dependencies, ensure you have all necessary build tools:


**Copy**
sudo apt install build-essential python3
