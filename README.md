#**Node-RED Automated Installation Script**

This repository provides an automated Node-RED installation script for Linux-based systems. This script updates your system, installs dependencies, sets up Node-RED, and ensures it runs on boot using systemd.

#**Introduction**

This tutorial will guide you through using an automated script to install Node-RED on a Linux system. The script will set up:

**Node.js version 18**


**Node-RED and related packages**


A systemd service to ensure Node-RED runs on boot

#Prerequisites

**Before running the script, ensure the following:**

A Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)

A non-root user with sudo access

Internet access to download necessary packages

**How to Use the Script**

1. Install Curl

sudo apt install curl

2. Install Bash

sudo apt install bash

3. **Copy**

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hzqzbrdn/node-red-installation/main/node-tailscale_install.sh | bash


**This command will:
**

Download the script

Automatically execute the installation process


**Option 2: Clone the Repository and Run the Script**
Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the script manually:

Clone the repository:

**Copy**

git clone https://github.com/hzqzbrdn/node-red-installation.git
